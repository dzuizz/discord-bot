## Introduction

Welcome to the **Build-your-own-x: Discord Bot** project! This guide will help you create a Discord bot using Node.js and discord.js. Your bot will be capable of recognizing users and understanding the commands they issue within your server.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Deployment

To deploy the bot, follow these steps:

1. **Simple Deployment:**

   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

2. **Deployment with Hot Reloading:**
   If you prefer to use hot reloading during development, you can deploy the bot using hot-esm:
