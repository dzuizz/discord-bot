# Build-your-own-x: discord-bot with node.js & discord.js

---

Imagine a bot... that can know who YOU ðŸ«µ are and what server ðŸ’» you reside in (or at least the command you put does)

## Deployment

To install the required packages, run

```sh
npm install
```

To deploy the bot, run

```sh
node index.js
```

To deploy the bot with hot reloading (with hot-esm), run

```sh
node --experimental-loader hot-esm index.js
```
